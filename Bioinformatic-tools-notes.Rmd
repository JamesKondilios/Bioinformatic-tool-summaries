*AXE:*
Axe is a read de-multiplexer, useful in situations where sequence reads contain the barcodes that uniquely distinguish samples. When GBS data is produced a single output file is produced containing sequence reads from all samples of a certain length. Each read has a barcode specifying which sample it belongs to. AXE matches external barcode data to the barcodes in each read. It then writes reads belonging to each sample to a seperate file. 
```{bash Axe, eval=FALSE}
# working directory jk9065/gdata/rawdata/Emarg_trans345_Brachy

axe-demux -m 0 -c ON -b Emarg_trans345_Brachy.axe -f Emarginata345_Brachy5_NoIndex_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz -r Emarginata345_Brachy5_NoIndex_L005_R2_001.fastq.gz -I demuxed/

```


*GATK4 Haplotype Caller:*
Call germline SNPs and indels via local re-assembly of haplotypes. It is capible of identifying SNPs and indels simultaneously via local de-novo assembly of haplotypes 
```{bash GATK4-VariantCaller, eval = FALSE}

```

*GATK4 GenotypeGVCFs:*
